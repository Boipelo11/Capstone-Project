    <h2 class="main__h2">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Soweto uprising regime was formed by the youth in 1976, when they were protesting against the <strong>BANTU EDUCATION</strong> system!
    The word 'bantu' is derived from the zulu word 'abantu' which means people, however, it was more inclined to the 
    derogitory and condenscending bate against black people. This education system meant that the school pupils would learn 
    in Afrikaans as a medium language. Moreover, the quality of the education was not empowering black people - oppression was the mandate.
    The day marked history for South Africans because it brought about the change we are currently living in as 
    the youth of South Africa. It did not only bring value in education, it exposed the youth to more opportunities
    such as art, entrepreneurship, technology and travel! 

    As revolutionary as it was - many lives were lost, many homes were broken and many people faced unjust prosecutions. This day
    is not only a 'joyful praise', it also commemorates the people who sacrificed their lives for the generations which followed them. 
    To-date, there are still people who went missing and were never found. This continues to be a bittersweet day for 
    South Africans.</p>

    <h2 class="main__h2">Are We Really Free?</h2>
    <p>This question is lingering amongst many young people in todays South Africa. If the youth of 1976 was fighting for the betterment of education
    and its fruits, why then are so many of us unemployed, drowning in substance abuse, fighting poverty and resorting to crime for survival?
    So much can still be done because we are not bound by any constitution from improving our standards of living. Freedom 
    in todays instance is helping young people to become more aware of careers, lifestyles and solutions which align with the future 
    we are heading to. We must focus on what 1st World countries are growing into and then implement it into our own education system.</p>

    <h2 class="main__h2">Celebrations</h2>
    <p>The moment you come across adults roaming the streets in 
    school uniform, then you know it's on! Many people across the    
    country will be celebrating the day in meaningful ways and       
    reminding the youth to embrace their skills,gifts, freedom and
    innovative minds. Vilakazi Street remains to be one of the most 
    popular streets in the country and this is where the 1976 riot 
    ignited. The street has become a tourist attraction and multi-business 
    location - if you have not been there, please take time to visit 
    the place this year. We are also hoping to celebrate more 
    business ventures and success stories of young people. This 
    day is always a remarkable one for South Africans!</p>
